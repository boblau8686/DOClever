,然后将您开发工程下的根地址替换为localhost:36742即可开启您的Mock之旅！\\n            </el-row>\\n        </expand>\\n        <expand class=\\\"row\\\" style=\\\"border-radius: 5px;box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0,0,0,.12), 0 0

defineFunction.\r\n *\r\n * The first argument to defineFunction is a single name or a list of names.\r\n * All functions named in such a list will share a single implementation.\r\n *\r\n * Each declared function can have associated properties, which\r\n * include the following:\r\n *\r\n *  - numArgs: The number of arguments the function takes.\r\n *             If this is the only property, it can be passed as a number\r\n *             instead of an element of a properties object.\r\n *  - argTypes: (optional) An array corresponding to each argument of the\r\n *              function, giving the type of argument that should be parsed. Its\r\n *              length should be equal to `numArgs + numOptionalArgs`. Valid\r\n *              types:\r\n *               - \"size\": A size-like thing, such as \"1em\" or \"5ex\"\r\n *               - \"color\": An html color, like \"#abc\" or \"blue\"\r\n *               - \"original\": The same type as the environment that the\r\n *                             function being parsed is in (e.g. used for the\r\n *                             bodies of functions like \\color where the first\r\n *                             argument is special and the second argument is\r\n *                             parsed normally)\r\n *              Other possible types (probably shouldn't be used)\r\n *               - \"text\": Text-like (e.g. \\text)\r\n *               - \"math\": Normal math\r\n *              If undefined, this will be treated as an appropriate length\r\n *              array of \"original\" strings\r\n *  - greediness: (optional) The greediness of the function to use ungrouped\r\n *                arguments.\r\n *\r\n *                E.g. if you have an expression\r\n *                  \\sqrt \\frac 1 2\r\n *                since \\frac has greediness=2 vs \\sqrt's greediness=1, \\frac\r\n *                will use the two arguments '1' and '2' as its two arguments,\r\n *                then that whole function will be used as the argument to\r\n *                \\sqrt. On the other hand, the expressions\r\n *                  \\frac \\frac 1 2 3\r\n *                and\r\n *                  \\frac \\sqrt 1 2\r\n *                will fail because \\frac and \\frac have equal greediness\r\n *                and \\sqrt has a lower greediness than \\frac respectively. To\r\n *                make these parse, we would have to change them to:\r\n *                  \\frac {\\frac 1 2} 3\r\n *                and\r\n *                  \\frac {\\sqrt 1} 2\r\n *\r\n *                The default value is `1`\r\n *  - allowedInText: (optional) Whether or not the function is allowed inside\r\n *                   text mode (default false)\r\n *  - numOptionalArgs: (optional) The number of optional arguments the function\r\n *                     should parse. If the optional arguments aren't found,\r\n *                     `null` will be passed to the handler in their place.\r\n *                     (default 0)\r\n *\r\n * The last argument is that implementation, the handler for the function(s).\r\n * It is called to handle these functions and their arguments.\r\n * It receives two arguments:\r\n *  - context contains information and references provided by the parser\r\n *  - args is an array of arguments obtained from TeX input\r\n * The context contains the following properties:\r\n *  - funcName: the text (i.e. name) of the function, including \\\r\n *  - parser: the parser object\r\n *  - lexer: the lexer object\r\n *  - positions: the positions in the overall string of the function\r\n *               and the arguments.\r\n * The latter three should only be used to produce error messages.\r\n *\r\n * The function should return an object with the following keys:\r\n *  - type: The type of element that this is. This is then used in\r\n *          buildHTML/buildMathML to determine which function\r\n *          should be called to build this node into a DOM node\r\n * Any other data can be added to the

Can be called without `new`.\n *\n * ##### presetName\n *\n * MarkdownIt provides named presets as a convenience to quickly\n * enable/disable active syntax rules and options for common use cases.\n *\n * - [\"commonmark\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/commonmark.js) -\n *   configures parser to strict [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) mode.\n * - [default](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/default.js) -\n *   similar to GFM, used when no preset name given. Enables all available rules,\n *   but still without html, typographer & autolinker.\n * - [\"zero\"](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/presets/zero.js) -\n *   all rules disabled. Useful to quickly setup your config via `.enable()`.\n *   For example, when you need only `bold` and `italic` markup and nothing else.\n *\n * ##### options:\n *\n * - __html__ - `false`. Set `true` to enable HTML tags in source. Be careful!\n *   That's not safe! You may need external sanitizer to protect output from XSS.\n *   It's better to extend features via plugins, instead of enabling HTML.\n * - __xhtmlOut__ - `false`. Set `true` to add '/' when closing single tags\n *   (`<br />`). This is needed only for full CommonMark compatibility. In real\n *   world you will need HTML output.\n * - __breaks__ - `false`. Set `true` to convert `\\n` in paragraphs into `<br>`.\n * - __langPrefix__ - `language-`. CSS language class prefix for fenced blocks.\n *   Can be useful for external highlighters.\n * - __linkify__ - `false`. Set `true` to autoconvert URL-like text to links.\n * - __typographer__  - `false`. Set `true` to enable [some language-neutral\n *   replacement](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/lib/rules_core/replacements.js) +\n *   quotes beautification (smartquotes).\n * - __quotes__ - `“”‘’`, String or Array. Double + single quotes replacement\n *   pairs, when typographer enabled and smartquotes on. For example, you can\n *   use `'«»„“'` for Russian, `'„“‚‘'` for German, and\n *   `['«\\xA0', '\\xA0»', '‹\\xA0', '\\xA0›']` for French (including nbsp).\n * - __highlight__ - `null`. Highlighter function for fenced code blocks.\n *   Highlighter `function (str, lang)` should return escaped HTML. It can also\n *   return empty string if the source was not changed and should be escaped\n *   externaly. If result starts with <pre... internal wrapper is skipped.\n *\n * ##### Example\n *\n * ```javascript\n * // commonmark mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')('commonmark');\n *\n * // default mode\n * var md = require('markdown-it')();\n *\n * // enable everything\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   html: true,\n *   linkify: true,\n *   typographer: true\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ##### Syntax highlighting\n *\n * ```js\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value;\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return ''; // use external default escaping\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * Or with full wrapper override (if you need assign class to `<pre>`):\n *\n * ```javascript\n * var hljs = require('highlight.js') // https://highlightjs.org/\n *\n * // Actual default values\n * var md = require('markdown-it')({\n *   highlight: function (str, lang) {\n *     if (lang && hljs.getLanguage(lang)) {\n *       try {\n *         return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' +\n *                hljs.highlight(lang, str, true).value +\n *                '</code></pre>';\n *       } catch (__) {}\n *     }\n *\n *     return '<pre class=\"hljs\"><code>' + md.utils.escapeHtml(str) + '</code></pre>';\n *   }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n **/\nfunction MarkdownIt(presetName, options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof MarkdownIt)) {\n    return new MarkdownIt(presetName, options);\n  }\n\n  if (!options) {\n    if (!utils.isString(presetName)) {\n      options = presetName || {};\n      presetName = 'default';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * MarkdownIt#inline -> ParserInline\n   *\n   * Instance of [[ParserInline]].
